**Deeper Insights:**

Business lending makes up ~59% of the bank‚Äôs total loan portfolio.

Checking accounts hold 38% more funds than savings accounts ‚Äî suggesting customers prefer liquid deposit accounts over long-term savings.

With $1.49B in deposits and $1.71B in loans, the loan-to-deposit ratio is ~115% ‚Äî slightly aggressive, meaning the bank is lending more than it has in deposits.

**Deeper Insights:**

High-income clients dominate loans ‚Äî a concentration risk if the high-income group faces market shocks.

Credit card lending is minimal, suggesting a missed opportunity in consumer lending.

Loan concentration in specific occupations could be risky if those industries face downturns.

**Deeper Insights:**

High-income individuals not only dominate loans but also deposits ‚Äî a double dependency risk.

European clients provide the largest share of both deposits and loans ‚Äî a geographic concentration risk.

Social Workers leading deposits is unusual ‚Äî possibly due to institutional deposits or a few high-value accounts in that category.

**Foreign Currency Accounts:** $33.97M

**Engagement Accounts:** 1,179 (~99% of clients)

**Deeper Insights:**

Fees make up a relatively small fraction of total revenue potential ‚Äî suggesting untapped fee-based income opportunities.

Foreign currency deposits are just 2.3% of total deposits ‚Äî potential for growth in forex-linked products.

Nearly all clients are ‚Äúengaged‚Äù (have active accounts), which is a strong retention indicator.

| **Risk Factor**                 | **Exposure**  | **Reason for Concern**                                                                                              | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                         |
|----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Income Concentration             | High          | 50%+ of loans and deposits come from high-income clients ‚Äî vulnerable if this group‚Äôs economy slows.                 | Diversify lending/deposit base to mid and low-income segments.                   |
| Geographic Concentration         | High          | European clients dominate both deposits and loans (~44% of deposits, largest share of loans).                        | Expand into other regions to reduce geographic risk.                             |
| Product Concentration ‚Äì Loans    | High          | 60% of loan portfolio in business lending; low diversification in consumer lending.                                  | Increase retail loan products (e.g., credit cards, personal loans).              |
| Product Concentration ‚Äì Deposits | Medium        | Checking accounts hold significantly more than savings ‚Äî risk if clients withdraw large amounts.                     | Introduce incentives for long-term savings products.                             |
| Loan-to-Deposit Ratio             | Medium-High   | 115% ‚Äî aggressive lending could cause liquidity strain in downturn.                                                  | Build deposit base, especially from stable sources.                              |
| Occupational Risk                | Medium        | Loans and deposits concentrated in a few professions ‚Äî industry downturns could affect repayment.                    | Broaden client base across more occupations.                                     |
| Low Fee Income                   | Low-Moderate  | $22.56M in fees ‚Äî small portion of total business.                                                                    | Develop more fee-based services (insurance, wealth management).                  |
| Low Foreign Currency Holdings    | Low           | Only 2.3% of deposits ‚Äî low exposure to FX products.                                                                  | Market FX and international products to existing clients.                        |
